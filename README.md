## Features
Grapholscape provides advanced and interactive tools to visually inspect all components of the ontology: you can search for predicates, filter elements on the diagram and get information about each element on the screen.
* Search for predicates and their instances through all diagrams contained in the ontology
* Re-arrange GUI's modules floating above the diagram
* Get detailed information about selected element
* Get the OWL2 translation for selected element
* Filter elements that are not necessary for your analysis
* Multi-diagrammatic inspection that allows you to navigate through all diagrams that builds up the ontology

## Usage | [Demo](https://obdasystems.github.io/grapholscape/)
You can try it [here](https://obdasystems.github.io/grapholscape/) or just clone the repository and open the index.html, then select an example or drop your custom .graphol file in the box on the right side.

## What is Graphol?
GRAPHOL is a visual language for developing ontologies and offers a completely graphical representation of ontologies to users, in order to be easy understood by people who are not skilled in logic.\
